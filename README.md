We are going to use SQL queries to analyse the following:
The best selling genre in USA
Performance of the sales representative
Sales by country
Purchase of albums vs purchase of individual tracks
Which artist is used in the most playlists?
How many tracks have been purchased vs not purchased?
Is the range of tracks in the store reflective of their sales popularity?
Do protected vs non-protected media types have an effect on popularity?
